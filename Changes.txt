UserDAO 
access specifier - made private

saveUser method returns boolean status now, instead of void
getUsers returns list instead of arraylist, (coding practise - coding to interfaces)

getUsers - removed the try catch block
deleteUser - removed try-catch, user compare is using equals method instead of ==

updateUser - comparison based on equals method, return type is boolean now
findUser - instead of == , equalsIgnoreMethod is used

Users
made private, instance variables
added toString, hashCode, equals
(comparison of user objects is based on Name, case insensitive)

UserResource class
update the add User method
